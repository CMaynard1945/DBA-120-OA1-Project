# DBA-120-OA1-Project
Final Project for DBA-120-OA1 Colton Maynard

Here is my final project for DBA-120-OA1. It consists of a 5 table database for a hypothecial student record system. The database has been normalized to reduce redundancy and includes the use of Primary and Foriegn keys to increase usability. Included are screenshots for both the code and successful execution of CRUD Operations using PHPAdmin/XAMPP software.

As a note, I included screenshots of the CRUD operations as I could not get the included screen recording application on my desktop to work.
